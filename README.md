# CSCI5461-Final-Project
### We tested our different models in different branches in order to make collaboration easier. The branches are organized as so:
* main: the datasets we used, original dataset processing, and original evaluation methods
* svm: SVM model
* knn: KNN model
* random_forest: RF model
* naive_bayes: NB model
* mlp: MLP model
* oversampling_testing: different methods we tested to combat dataset imbalance
